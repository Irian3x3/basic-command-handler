# Command Handler
This repository is a basic command handler which I wrote by myself.  
You may use this command handler code, as long as you credit me by posting [the url of this repo](../../) somewhere in your bot.

## How to use
Run the command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Irian3x3/basic-command-handler
```

## If you find an issue in the code, [create an issue](../../issues/new) and I'll try to get back to you
